                    <div class="assign-content">
                        <p>
                            I've always believed that experience is the best teacher. All of us learn in different ways, but for me, I learn better when I do it myself. As I reflect, I try my best to write without looking at any of the activities to be honest about what I truly learned. I treated the first assignment as a written work given to assess our knowledge about Web Development. It’s like something that gives us a hint of what we should look forward to in this subject. Some of us were either unfamiliar with how things work in this subject or not skilled enough to answer on our own. As a result, this work has given me the opportunity to explore and learn some concepts in advance, which expanded my knowledge of the subject.<br><br>
                            The activities, for me, are not that difficult, and I thank our professor for that since we’re still learning and trying to figure things out. Despite this, there are parts of it that I struggled with completing. The first two activities were not that difficult since I learned HTML in advance. CSS, on the other hand, is where I really had a difficult time because I did it in a rush, which is my problem, and I also struggled to figure out how to use Bootstrap. All the remaining activities were not that complicated since the basics of programming were taught since first year, and it’s not that different from other programming languages.<br><br>
                            I believe I did well in the quizzes, except in CSS. I have always believed that I’m a fast learner, which is not an issue. The real problem is I tend to forget things easily if I’m not consistent. Hence, by the time we took the quiz, I had already forgotten the lesson. What I learned from both the activities and quizzes is mostly the same, but if there’s one thing that will stay in my mind, and maybe I’ll carry for the rest of my life, it’s the importance of consistency.<br><br>
                            Yes, being a fast learner sounds nice, but seeing other people with passion, people who continuously work hard for growth, is something I always envy. Sometimes, when we get things easily, we find it difficult to appreciate the results. As I was writing this, it made me reflect on myself. Maybe next year, I will also have the passion to do the things I love.

                            "Push forward, even when it's hard. Every step you take leads to a better tomorrow." This quote motivates me to keep pushing through. We all have different stories to carry as we go, and the first half of this semester's journey ended well. I would say I learned something that expanded my knowledge about the subject.<br><br>
                            The assignments given served as tasks that showed us a glimpse of what we would learn as the semester pushed through. They tested our knowledge about database administration and somehow encouraged us to explore and learn in advance. As expected, I learned some concepts that were unfamiliar to me. Although I had read articles and blogs about the subject, it was quite difficult to understand since some concepts were complex, and I hadn’t tried using them.<br><br>
                            The activities, if you'll ask, were not that difficult if you really wanted to learn. I listened and engaged throughout the discussions, which helped me complete the activities easily. I've always believed that we attract what we think, so what makes any task even more difficult is our negative thoughts. Sometimes it's the voices in our heads that make things difficult for us because we believe them more than what we know about ourselves. I was able to finish the tasks since I familiarized myself with the syntax, which I think is one of the reasons why others find it complicated. However, once you memorize the syntax, I think it wouldn't be that hard. I'm just glad that I was able to explore and learn how to create a database.<br><br>
                            There was only one quiz in the subject, which I did well on, in my opinion. The content of the quiz was about the introduction to database administration, which was discussed on the same day. I was able to answer it easily since the lesson was still fresh in my mind. Aside from the discussion, I could also remember the things I had learned from the assignment given beforehand.<br><br>
                            Overall, I'm proud that I was able to learn something, and I hope that everything I learned will keep me motivated and lead to greater things. As the saying goes, "Just keep going, because the best part of our story is found on the last page."

                    <p>A compilation of assignments, activities, and quizzes completed during the midterm period. These tasks helped me assess my understanding of the subject and pinpoint areas where I needed more practice. The activities allowed me to apply what I had learned, while the quizzes gave me the opportunity to reinforce and review my knowledge.
